## NOTICE

I am not responsible for illegal or misuse of this program, this program has been made to learn about vectors in C++.

## Introduction

Simple program which removes the duplicate accounts from your combolist / accountlists.

## How to use

Compile the program and use `awdawawdawd.exe output.txt` (The name can be anything)

## How it works

The program reads the combolist and stores the accounts in a vector, then it checks if the account is already in the vector, if it is, it will not add it to the vector, if it is not, it will add it to the vector.
